I have previously written about [event-driven architectures](/en/articles/event-driven-architectures) and how they help agile teams deliver resilient, scalable, flexible, and adaptable systems. However, it comes at the cost of complexity: distributed complexity.

In a highly distributed system, monitoring alone is not enough. Observability must be a core characteristic. Without it, you may find yourself regretting the move to a distributed architecture and even advocating for a return to the monolith.

> To be clear, monoliths still have a place in many organisations. If you don't need the added complexity, don't introduce it. However, as your engineering team grows, the benefits of a distributed system become more apparent.

## Monitoring and Observability

Let's go back to the basics and break down what monitoring and observability are.

### Monitoring

Monitoring focuses on tracking known metrics and alerts. It's reactive by nature and serves as a good starting point to determine whether a system is working as expected.

You care about each individual transaction.

You use logs and metrics to collect information, build dashboards to track trends, and set alerts for when a metric exceeds a threshold or an error log message appears.

Monitoring helps you understand individual components of your system and pinpoint specific issues. It has served us well for many years, but it is no longer enough.

### Observability

Observability, on the other hand, provides a higher-level, aggregated view of the system. Instead of focusing solely on individual transactions, you analyse patterns across all signals, to identify issues before they escalate.

With observability, you can:

- Gain a clearer understanding of system behaviour and performance.
- Find cause-and-effect relationships across components.
- Identify bottlenecks, complexity, and architectural problems.

Observability is not a new concept. It was first coined by Rudolf E. Kálmán (see [his paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474667017700948?via%3Dihub)), and the main idea still applies: understanding a system's internal state by analysing its outputs.

## Why does observability matter?

Today's complex distributed systems require a higher-level view.

For example, you can monitor your home energy usage to reduce consumption or detect when a fridge is about to [break down](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306261919300613).

But if you're managing the entire energy grid, you need more than individual data points.

- You analyse weather patterns to predict renewable energy production.
- You study social behaviour to determine when people will switch on their kettle, and other behavioural patterns.

Your focus shifts from isolated events to aggregated insights and predictions derived from multiple signals.

Our distributed systems may not be as complex as an energy grid, but they share similar challenges.

Observability provides that extra level of understanding, helping to:

- Identify patterns before they cause failures.
- Categorise, diagnose, and resolve issues faster.
- Optimise performance and enhance user experience (including for developers), to name just a few.

Observability isn't a new challenge — it's a familiar one that has grown more complex due to modern architecture patterns and needs.

This is where OpenTelemetry (OTel) comes in — a framework designed to standardise telemetry collection across systems and address these challenges.

## OpenTelemetry (OTel)

OpenTelemetry is an open source, vendor- and tool-agnostic, observability framework and toolkit. It was born in [2019, when OpenTracing and OpenCensus](https://medium.com/opentracing/a-roadmap-to-convergence-b074e5815289) deprecated themselves to focus entirely on OpenTelemetry.

Its goal is to simplify the generation, collection, processing, and exporting of telemetry data (signals).

While OpenTelemetry is still relatively young, it is actively developed and widely adopted by major industry players. In fact, it is the largest project within the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/projects/) ([CNCF](https://www.cncf.io)), alongside projects like Kubernetes, Backstage, CloudEvents and many more.

### How does it work?

One of OpenTelemetry's main goals is auto-instrumentation — it should "just work" for common libraries and frameworks.

The telemetry data is typically:

1. Generated by instrumented services.
2. Collected by an OpenTelemetry Collector.
3. Processed and exported to your preferred observability platform.

If you've used LogStash or worked with data pipelines, this pattern will feel familiar.

In OpenTelemetry, data is represented as signals.

### Signals

Currently, OpenTelemetry supports four core types of signals:

- [Traces](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/traces/): The path of a request through your application.
- [Metrics](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/metrics/): A measurement captured at runtime.
- [Logs](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/logs/): A recording of an event.
- [Baggage](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/baggage/): Contextual information that is passed between signals.

I won't cover each in detail here, as I will explore these in more detail in an OpenTelemetry Signals post. Other emerging signals include Events and Profiles — for real user monitoring.

## What comes next?

Modern distributed systems require us to rethink how we monitor and observe them. OpenTelemetry is a major step towards standardising telemetry data collection.

But observability is more than just gathering data — it's about collecting the right signals that provide actionable insights.

In my next post, I'll take a deeper dive into OpenTelemetry signals — traces, metrics, logs, and new types like events and real user monitoring profiles.

Observability isn't just about more data — it's about the right data, delivering real insights that drive action.

Stay tuned!
