&lt;p>I considered using Medium, but it does not separate content by language. Hugo, on the other hand, is a fast, easy‑to‑use static site generator that supports multilingual sites out of the box—and it gave me a chance to play with Go again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This post is a concise run‑through of Hugo’s excellent documentation. If you’re new to Hugo, consult the &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/">quick start guide&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://ismaelmartinez.github.io/ismaelmartinez.me.uk/en/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ismaelmartinez.github.io/ismaelmartinez.me.uk/en/about/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hello! I&amp;rsquo;m Ismael Martinez Ramos, a Principal Software Developer with a passion for technology and learning. This blog is a space where I share my thoughts, experiences, and knowledge on various topics related to software development, technology, and life in general.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am the maintainer of &lt;a href="https://www.github.com/ismaelmartinez/teams-for-linux">teams-for-linux&lt;/a>, a project that I rescued in 2019, which has evolved and, somehow, become quite popular.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I got an allotment in 2021, and I enjoy spending time outdoors, growing vegetables, and connecting with nature. Gardening has taught me patience, resilience, and the joy of nurturing life, which I find parallels many aspects of software development.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
