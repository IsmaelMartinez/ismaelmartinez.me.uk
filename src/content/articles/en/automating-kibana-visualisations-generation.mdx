As a developer, when I find myself doing the same task over and over, I take a step back and consider if there is a better way.

## The Problem

Maintaining synchronization between code changes and Kibana visualizations in microservices and AWS Lambda environments is a repetitive manual task. Every time logging changes, the corresponding visualizations need updating. This violates the DRY principle and wastes valuable developer time.

## The Solution

I created **logger-to-kibana**, an open-source tool that parses source code and automatically generates Kibana visualizations based on logging statements found in the code.

## How It Works

The tool analyzes Python source files to identify log messages and creates metric visualizations grouped by:

- Subfolder structure
- Filename
- Function name

For example, given this Python code:

```python
import logging
from datetime import datetime

LOG = logging.getLogger()

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    LOG.info('lambda_handler called')
    return {'message': datetime.now()}
```

The tool generates a corresponding metric visualization in Kibana.

## Installation & Usage

```bash
pip install logger-to-kibana
logger-to-kibana process_generate_and_send -f <folder>
```

This processes all Python files in the specified directory, parsing them via regex to identify log statements.

## Key Benefits

- Identifying redundant or inconsistent log messages
- Ensuring code and visualizations stay synchronized
- Auto-generating documentation about application logging
- Integration into deployment pipelines for continuous updates

## Future Direction

The plan is to extend support to other monitoring systems like CloudWatch and Grafana, potentially renaming the tool to something more generic.

If you find yourself manually creating Kibana visualizations every time your logging changes, give logger-to-kibana a try and let me know what you think.
