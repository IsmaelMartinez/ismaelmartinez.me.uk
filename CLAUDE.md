# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run build        # Build for production (output in ./dist)
npm run preview      # Preview production build
npm run lint         # ESLint across the repo
npm run typecheck    # Astro + TypeScript check
npm test             # Run Vitest suite (build tests require ./dist to exist)
npm run check-links  # Validate internal links in ./dist (run after build)
```

## Architecture

This is a multilingual Astro static site with three supported locales: English (en), Spanish (es), and Catalan (cat). The site uses file-based routing with locale prefixes (all pages live under `/en/`, `/es/`, `/cat/`).

### Internationalisation

The i18n system centres on `src/i18n/translations.ts`, which exports the `useTranslations(lang)` function used throughout components. Every UI string is keyed in this file across all three locales. The `getLangFromUrl()` and `getLocalizedPath()` helpers handle routing between language versions.

Pages are defined once under `src/pages/[lang]/…` as dynamic routes that use `getStaticPaths()` to emit `/en/`, `/es/`, and `/cat/` variants (see `docs/plans/2026-02-15-phase4-security-maintainability-design.md` for the deduplication rationale). The root `src/pages/index.astro` redirects to the default locale (`/en/`), and `src/pages/404.astro` is the shared 404.

### Content

Static data (projects, links, health, fun) lives in TypeScript files under `src/data/` with inline translations per object. Articles use Astro Content Collections in `src/content/articles/{locale}/` with MDX format. The schema is defined in `src/content.config.ts` (Astro 6's top-level content config location).

Articles follow POSSE (Publish Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere) strategy per ADR 001 in `docs/adr/`. Frontmatter includes `originalUrl` and `originalPlatform` to link back to syndicated copies on Medium/Dev.to.

### Arcade games

Arcade pages live under `src/pages/[lang]/fun/`. Newer games (Tank Duel, Pixel Park, Microcity, Line Hold, Cascade) split pure game logic into DOM-free TypeScript modules under `src/games/<game>/` (unit-tested in `tests/games/`) with a single `init<Game>()` entry the page calls; shared utilities (fixed-timestep loop, hi-DPI canvas setup (`canvas.ts` — DPR-scaled backing store with a logical-coordinate contract; pointer math must use its `toLogical()`, never `canvas.width`), per-device top-10 high-score tables with arcade initials entry (`highscores.ts` + `scoreboard.ts` + `src/components/HighScoreTable.astro`), grid helpers, shared BFS pathfinding (`pathfind.ts` — a walkability predicate over the flat grid; Pixel Park, Syndicate, and Line Hold all route through it), isometric renderer) live in `src/games/engine/`. Three engine modules are the *required* channel for game feedback — new games must not re-paste them: `toast.ts` (`createToaster` — DOM toast stack, cap 3, timed auto-remove, swap-safe timers), `effects.ts` (`createEffects` — canvas particle bursts + text floaters; per-game constants go in as construction options, bespoke spawn math hands finished particles to `emit()`, and a copy that genuinely can't fit the options stays local with a comment naming the divergence — today only Critter Rescue's), and the scoreboard's run-record API (`beginRun()` at run start, `bank(score)` on every gain → `{ best, newRecord }` for the HUD readout and the one-time record toast, `best()` for init-time HUD seeding). Render loops must not rebuild static full-canvas content (starfields, checkerboards, vignettes) per frame: bake it with `createStaticLayer` in `canvas.ts`, rebuilt via `setupHiDpiCanvas`'s `onApply` (its JSDoc carries the device-pixel alignment contract). The one exception is a full-canvas gradient fill that doubles as the frame clear (the sims' skies), which keeps a hoisted `CanvasGradient` instead. The iso cabinets' shared drawing idioms also live in the engine and are the required channel — don't re-derive them per game: `blockFaceCorners`/`blockSeamPath` in `iso.ts` (inset footprint corners + the W→S→E course line across a block's visible faces), `faceBandPath` (the interpolate-along-projected-edge quad behind shopfront glass, office strips, counter bands, and two-edge awning canvas; path-append so callers keep their own fill batching), and `blink` beside `hash01` in `canvas.ts` (the 1.5 Hz rooftop-beacon cadence, phase-offset by tile index). Geometry that is a pure function of slow-changing state gets cached, not recomputed per frame: Pixel Park bakes per-track-tile rail geometry into `railCache` keyed on `worldVersion:rotation`, and Microcity memoizes per-tile hashed variety (hash rolls + derived colour strings) per `type:level` key — both from the 2026-07-20 consolidation round (`docs/plans/2026-07-20-arcade-consolidation-2-drawing-idioms.md`). Render refactors that must not change output are verified byte-identically with `scripts/screenshot-games.js` (deterministic seeded-PRNG + stepped-rAF captures; not in CI — see its header for the ad-hoc setup). Static labels render server-side via `useTranslations`; runtime-composed strings pass through `data-t-*` attributes on the game root. New games register a cabinet in `src/pages/[lang]/fun/index.astro`, which groups the floor into three labelled shelves (Action / Puzzle / Simulation) — each `arcadeGames` entry carries a `shelf` key and the shelf signs use the `fun.arcade.shelf.*` i18n keys. Line Hold (tower defense, `src/games/towerdefense/`) and Cascade (falling-block stacker with cascade-gravity chains, `src/games/cascade/` — its pure run state machine in `run.ts` lets tests play whole games headlessly) both shipped from `docs/plans/2026-07-12-next-arcade-game-design.md`. (Cascade renders as a flat top-down well, not the engine's isometric view — it is a newer cabinet by architecture, not an iso one.) Poo Poo Land was retired in the 2026-07-19 consolidation round (`docs/plans/2026-07-19-arcade-consolidation-plan.md` — it predated the architecture; its localStorage data and legacy key-migration entry survive in case it ever returns as a rebuild). The owner has chosen **deepening the existing cabinets over building new ones**, so the tenth-cabinet candidates queue (`docs/plans/2026-07-18-arcade-candidates-3.md`) is **parked indefinitely**; arcade work now improves the nine shipped cabinets, tracked from `docs/plans/2026-07-21-arcade-improvement-round-1.md` (audit + ranked rounds).

Scoring conventions, applied across every cabinet: each game keeps a per-device top-10 through `initScoreboard`; games whose runs can be long (Microcity, Pixel Park, Syndicate, Critter Rescue, Line Hold, Cascade) bank the run's best as it grows — `bank(score)` stashes automatically — so a closed tab never loses a record; every point gain is announced on screen the moment it lands (canvas floaters/score popups via `createEffects`); the number a finished run submits to the table is shown to the player rather than computed silently (e.g. Tank Duel's match score, Critter Rescue's bonus breakdown); and beating the device record mid-run earns a one-time toast driven by `bank()`'s `newRecord` flag.

### Layouts and Components

`src/layouts/Layout.astro` is the base layout with navigation, language switcher, and footer. `src/layouts/ArticleLayout.astro` handles article pages. Components in `src/components/` are shared across locales.

### Testing & CI

Vitest tests live under `tests/` (unit tests for i18n and reading-time, plus `tests/build/output.test.ts` which reads files from `./dist` and is skipped unless a build has been produced). The link checker in `scripts/check-links.js` walks built HTML in `./dist/` and verifies internal hrefs resolve to real files. CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs lint, typecheck, build, tests, link check, and Lighthouse CI on pushes to `main`/`develop` and PRs to `main`.

### Deployment

The deploy workflow (`.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml`) runs after a successful CI on `main` (and on a daily cron) to build and publish to GitHub Pages. Output goes to `./dist`. A `vercel.json` also exists as a fallback/mirror configuration.

## Repo Butler

This repo is monitored by [Repo Butler](https://github.com/IsmaelMartinez/repo-butler), a portfolio health agent that observes repo health daily and generates dashboards, governance proposals, and tier classifications.

**Your report:** https://ismaelmartinez.github.io/repo-butler/ismaelmartinez.me.uk.html
**Portfolio dashboard:** https://ismaelmartinez.github.io/repo-butler/
**Consumer guide:** https://github.com/IsmaelMartinez/repo-butler/blob/main/docs/consumer-guide.md

### Querying Reginald (the butler MCP server)

To query your repo's health tier, governance findings, and portfolio data from any Claude Code session, add the MCP server once (adjust the path to your local repo-butler checkout):

```bash
claude mcp add repo-butler node /path/to/repo-butler/src/mcp.js
```

Available tools: `get_health_tier`, `get_campaign_status`, `query_portfolio`, `get_snapshot_diff`, `get_governance_findings`, `trigger_refresh`.

When working on health improvements, check the per-repo report for the current tier checklist and use the consumer guide for fix instructions.

If this repo deploys a page, set its GitHub repository Homepage URL (the Website field in the repo's About section — not `package.json`'s `homepage`) to the canonical URL. That's how repo-butler surfaces the deployed link in dashboards and agent cards.
