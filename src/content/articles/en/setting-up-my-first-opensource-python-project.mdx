This is the start of a series documenting the creation of my first PyPI project. I acknowledge this represents both my first open-source contribution and initial Python endeavour, so there's considerable room for improvement.

## Project Overview

The project is called **logger-to-kibana**, and it centres on automation principles. The tool parses loggers in code and generates Kibana visualizations from log messages encountered during execution.

## Key Features

The project includes three main commands:

- `process` — processes a folder
- `process_and_generate` — processes a folder and generates visualizations
- `process_generate_and_send` — executes full pipeline including transmission to Kibana

## Installation

Users can install dependencies via:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And access help documentation by running:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Configuration

Default settings exist in `settings.ini`, with customisation available through the `LOGGER_TO_KIBANA_CONFIG` environment variable.

This allows you to configure:

- The Kibana endpoint URL
- Authentication credentials
- Visualization templates and defaults
- Log parsing patterns

## What's Next

In the upcoming parts of this series, I'll cover:

- Setting up CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Publishing to PyPI
- Writing tests and documentation
- Handling community contributions

I welcome constructive feedback and encourage readers to develop open-source solutions addressing repetitive tasks. The project is available on PyPI and GitHub for contribution opportunities.

If you've gone through a similar process of publishing your first open-source project, I'd love to hear about your experience and any tips you might have.
