Hello! I'm Ismael Martinez Ramos, a Principal Software Developer with a passion for technology and learning. This blog is a space where I share my thoughts, experiences, and knowledge on various topics related to software development, technology, and life in general.

I am the maintainer of [teams-for-linux](https://www.github.com/ismaelmartinez/teams-for-linux), a project that I rescued in 2019, which has evolved and, somehow, become quite popular.

I got an allotment in 2021, and I enjoy spending time outdoors, growing vegetables, and connecting with nature. Gardening has taught me patience, resilience, and the joy of nurturing life, which I find parallels many aspects of software development.

I hope that my blog can inspire and help others in their own journeys.

The reasons for building my own blog are a few, but mainly for the lack of multilingual support in the platforms I tried, and the desire to have full control over my content and how it is presented.

If you have any questions, suggestions, or just want to connect, feel free to reach out through the contact page or on social media. I'm always open to discussions.

If you're interested in my professional career, you can find more information on my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ismael-martinez-ramos/).
